Not web related.
I know we are all working from home, but taking time to rest is important. Probably more so in this uncertain period of time.
Over the past few weeks, I have been guilty of not achieving the right work-life balance. Some days I struggle to find the time for a decent-sized lunch break or to fit my necessary daily exercise into the day. I finish work and I am exhausted, resigning myself to read, sit in front of the TV or on my PlayStation.
The last 7 months have been about experimentation. Trying to find a working pattern that is adaptable in the current time. Allowing for work, play, exercise and rest. I've had weeks where it has been a disaster. I've hated my job and the people around me. Other weeks have been perfect and I've felt like I am on cloud 9 and can live through this situation for months to come.
On the good weeks, the key thing that I was doing was resting properly. Rest takes two forms, Active Rest and Rest Rest. I am making these terms up, so forgive me if they already exist under a different name.
Active Rest is my daily walk, and my workouts, (either climbing, run or a weights workout) Taking time to be mindful. Think. Be at peace. If I don't get out before work for a walk, it sets my whole day onto a tilt and I struggle to pull things back into balance. This time is important because I process things. How am I feeling about the latest news? What does my day look like and how can I best approach it? These moments of active rest allow my mind to wander or be at peace. My mood enhanced and my mental health kept in balance. I know climbing doesn't sound like something that can be considered rest but when I am trying to solve how to ascend a problem there is a peaceful state that I am able to get myself into. I do end up exhausting my body but my mind comes away from a session refreshed.
Rest Rest is taking time to relax. The best form of rest for me is sitting down to read before bed. Something about being snuggled up in bed during this cold weather with a good book really lowers my heart rate and leads to a great night of sleep. Part of this is due to reducing screen time before bed but just the practice of being calm before bed works wonders for my body. Other forms this may take is simply sitting and watching TV or playing PlayStation. It is so important to have a little 'me' time. To recharge my batteries, because work is just that little bit harder right now due to the circumstances.
Taking time to rest is vital. This means taking holidays even if they are just to sit at home. Its a struggle to know that travel is not possible right now. I would give anything to take a few weeks off with my partner and explore some exotic new place but that isn't really the world we live in at the moment and so my holidays need to be spent to recharge mentally and get myself through this barrage of tidal waves that is a year.
Stay safe, and make sure to rest!
