I've been watching The Bear on Disney +. I must say, the show is absolutely amazing, but I don't want to go off-topic. One of the episodes in season 2 provides us with a peek into a 3-star restaurant located in Chicago that is committed to providing diners with an unforgettable experience. Their remarkable attention to detail is undeniable, and it is a testament to their dedication and hard work. Achieving this level of performance requires an unwavering commitment to precision, constantly striving to improve and surpass previous accomplishments. Pushing to reach new heights and achieve extraordinary things, each moment a culmination of those that came back. 
Is it worth pursuing the same accomplishment? To consistently improve ourselves. To dedicate the same level of care and effort into our work and the customers we serve?
Well, you better start by polishing the forks.
