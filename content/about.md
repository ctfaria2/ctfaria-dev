## About me

I am a software engineer with 10+ years of experience. I have worked at both start-ups and large companies and have a deep passion for solving problems and working with teams to improve various aspects of the developer experience.

I am currently working at Salsa where we are building a world-class solution for embedded payroll.

## Hobbies

My passion is bouldering and I climb regularly and have done since December 2017. Initially this started as a way to lose weight after a rough patch but I now am very interested in development and climbing training. This year I am pushing to climb my first V7.

I also love travelling and have done several trips with my wife, Joanna. Most notably, we took 6 months off at the end of 2022 and spent 3 months travelling around Central America and 3 months travelling around South-east Asia. It was incredible!
